# Wedding- Web Programming
Task for the Web Programming Module. We had to create a website to help choose the right Wedding venue. This involved using SQL queries to pull data from the server and displaying the data however we wanted.

# Tasks
* Task 1- catering.html
* Task 2- details.html
* Task 3- capacity.html
* Task 4- costs.html
* Task 5- wedding.php

Tasks 1-4 involved us creating the php files only. The specification was strict with the information it wanted on the website.
Task 5 involved us being more free and allowed us to create multiple files and add interactivity to our websites. I allowed data within my table to be clicked on and viewed in more detail.

# Archive
This repository is for archival purposes only and the actual websites can't be viewed as the databases needed to query aren't available.
